Optimistic rollups are in wide use today as a scalability add-on for blockchains like Ethereum. In such systems, Ethereum is referred to as L1 (Layer 1) and the rollup provides an environment called L2, which reduces fees and latency but cannot trustlessly and instantly interact with L1. One practical issue for optimistic rollups is that trustless transfers of tokens and ETH, as well as general messaging, from L2 to L1 are not finalized on L1 until the passing of a dispute window (which is typically 7 days today). In this paper, we explore methods for side-stepping the 7 day dispute window. We modify a popular rollup, Arbitrum, to enable withdraws to be traded on L1 before they are finalized, and combine them with a prediction market on L1 that effectively provides insurance in the event that the withdraws do not finalize. As a result, anyone (including contracts) on L1 can safely accept withdrawn tokens while the dispute window is open despite having no knowledge of what is happening on L2. All fees are set by open market operations.


%All fees in the arrangement---Alice pays a fee to withdraw fast, Bob is paid a fee for accepting unfinalized tokens, and Carol is awarded a fee for validating L2 and insuring the finality of the withdrawal---are set by open market operations.
